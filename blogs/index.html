		<h3 class="blog-img-description">This client had an inspiring story to tell of how She compeletly changed her life by playing a board game. While her story <em>is</em> motivating and entertaining, the grammar needed to be polished up a bit and the tone needed to be clarified. I captured her tone in a way that her audience would be just as enraptured reading the story, as they would be hearing it in person.</h3>

		<h3 class="blog-img-description">Corporate Housing isn't a term that many are familiar with, nor are they familiar with the benefits. Many real estate owners use Property Managers to manage thier homes to save themselves time and money. But is it really that profitable? Or is their an easier way to generate cashflow <em>and</em> still have time? With this post I had to do some research and analysis. What is the difference between Corporate Housing and Property Management? Which one takes less time and creates more money? When people visit my clients site, these are some of the questions they ask. I found the answers and wrote them in an easy to understand article

		<h3 class="blog-img-description">I myself was inspired while editing this blog post! As I corrected the grammar and the structure of the article, I began to ponder my own existence. What plan do I have? Do I want to wait till I am 65 and "retire"? Should this be a subheading or a Quote? Were some of the questions I considered while formatting this post.</h3>

		<h3 class="blog-img-description">This post was very personal to me, as I lived this exact same experience as well! While my client had written what she wanted to say, I truly wanted the readers to experience the bittersweet farewell of a beloved home. To be awed by the breathtaking new experiences and views of what life is like once we strip away the artificial necessities and embrace the rawness of life. With this post I used my storytelling abilities to paint her story alive.</h3>
